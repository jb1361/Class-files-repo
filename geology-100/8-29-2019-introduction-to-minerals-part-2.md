# Introduction To Minerals Part Two

## Basic identification of minerals
- Mineralogist use chemical composition 
- we will use physical properties to identify minerals
### Physical properties of minerals
- Color: the most noticeable feature, can get a very good idea of what the mineral is
	#### Rules of color regarding minerals
	- Different minerals can have the same color
	- Minerals can have impurities that can affect color
	- Weathering can change the color, It seems to be due to oxydizing 
	- Certain minerals can be identified by their distinctive color
- Luster: The refraction of the mineral
	- Metalic: if the mineral looks like a metal ex (pyrite, galinai)
	- Non Metalic: Doesnt look like a metal ex - quartz(vituous)
- Streak: Every mineral has a streak when you scratch it on a streak plate (not hardness)
	- Hematite is always a reddish brown streak
- Hardness: How hard the mineral is
- Cleavage: Where it breaks smothly ex. mica(it splits into sheets)
	- Perfect cleavage: always breaks smoothly
	- Cleavage and fracture: combo
	- All Fracture: most minerals are here
	#### Types of fractures
		- Conchoidal: curve or shell like 
		- Hackly: roughe jagged edges
- Specific gravity: change of water level divided by desity of water
### Special Properties of minerals
- Magnetism: attracted by a magnet (they contain a high level of iron)
- Electrical charge
- Radiactiviety
- Fluorescent
	- Phosphorescent
- Double Refraction - double image
	- Optical Projection
- Pisolitic Structure
- Taste
- Odor
- Triboluminescence
- Acid test
