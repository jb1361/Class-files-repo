## Ionian Numerals (Greek Numbering system)
1: α
2: β
3: α
4: δ
5: ε
6: ϛ
7: ζ
8: η
9: Θ
- their letters are used as numbers
- uses ( ʹ) character to denote a number and not a word. they use , (comma) to denote the thousands `only in the thousands place` 
- Use M to denoted the next three digits * 10,000 -> it is called a "myriad" ex. wleM,7tor
`lamda M ,sigma X B` is 303602

## Fractions with base 60 notation (Babylonian)
Reminder: 12,17;30,45 (12 is the 60s place, 17 is the ones place, 30 is 1/30, 45 is 1/45)
### To convert from base 10 to base 60
- 7.5 -> 7;30
- 21.8 -> 21;48 (4/5 = ?/60)
- 0.24

```
24/100 = 6/25 = ?/60 -> ...
0.24 = 0;14 + ....
How much in 0.4 copies of 1/60? | 0.4 * 60 = 24
0;14,24
```

```
100N = 28.28
-  N =  0.28
____________
99N = 28
  N = 28/99
```

```
60N = 20;20
- N =  0;20
___________
59N = 20
  N = 20/59
```

```
N = 10,15,20;10,15,20
N = -      0;10,15,20
(60^3 - 1)N = 10,15,20
	    = 10*60^2 + 15*60 + 20
	    = 4520
N = 4520/(60^3 -1)
```
## Egyptian Multiplication
```
  57      ~~1 57~~
x 28      ~~2 114~~
          4 228
          8 456
       +  16 912

it is a greedy algorithm
