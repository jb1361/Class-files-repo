Product worth regression

using current data try to answer even hansabout
future -- regression

can use regression in supervised learning

 ex: we can write an equation that takes a bunch of info: heinght, weight, DOB, batting avg, and predict the # of home runs


Take all input attributes and # of lifetime homeruns then build an accurate equation to predicgt lifetine # of home runs for any player

Assume we have a # of data points, I through M

I	2	3	4	M
Y	Y	Y	Y	Y
x1
x2
x3
xn

Y- lifetime # of home runs
x1....xn: height, weight, DOB, batting avg
1 through M : different players

height
X1,01 01-weight of the input (something that will have a higher effect ont he outcome should be weighed higher)

the best solution is the one that is going to minimize the differences acrss all data points between the predicted y and observed Y

we need to find 0s that produce the best predictions: least error

we can come up with a description for the total error of the model

we can get a 0 error

we can get a 0 error even if mode is very wrong
rather than adding all terms, add the square of the error 

cost function

J(0) = sumofi= M(Ypred-Yobs)^2
