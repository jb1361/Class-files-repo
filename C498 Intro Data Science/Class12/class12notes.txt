Hierarchical clustering analysis(Hca)

given a set of n items to be clustered, and an N * N
matrix, the process of clustering is 

1) start by assigning each item to its own clustere (initial assignment)
	N items generate N clusters
		*each cluster contains 1 item
		*the distance between the clusters equal the distance between the items they contains
		
2) find the closest(most similar) pair of clusters merge them into a single cluster

3)compute the distance between the new cluster and each of the old clusters

4)repeat steps 2 and 3 untill all items are clustered into a single cluster of size new

principal compound analysis
-linear transformation of data
-goal is to identify patterns in data
-allow us to detect correlations between variables


PCA Steps:

1) transform on N*d matrix X into an N*K matrix Y
2) compute mean for every dimension of the matrix x(d-dimensional mean vector)
3) compute covariance matrix of the matrix x (d x d matrix)
4) calculate the eigenvector of the covariance matrix
5) select m eigenvectors that coresponds to the largest m eigenvalues to be the new basis
