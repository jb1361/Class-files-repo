## Introduction To Geology

What is geology
- Study of earth
- The field observer is the geologist

Two broad areas of geology
- (1) Physical Geology: examining the materials composing earth
- (2) Historical Geology: Looks at the history of earth [Test 4]

### Major Subdivisions of Geology
- **Paleontology**: study of fosils
- **Mineralogy**: Study of minerals
- **Petrology**: study of rocks
- **Stratigraphy**: study of layered rocks
- **Speleology**: Study of caves
- **Seismology**: study of earthquakes
- **Volcanology**: Study of volcanoes
- **Pedology**: Study of soils
- **Hydrogeology**: Study of water
- **Geomorphology**: Study of land forms, how they change, and how they evolve

These will probably be on a vocab quiz or something

### Important Values/ Uses of Geology

- 1: We get constructions materials, metals, chemicals, etc, from minerals
- 2: Learn about life and conditions in the past
- 3: Effects on the earth's surface (soil erosions and flood control)
- 4: Knowledge of the structure and origin of the earth
- 5: Location of Fossil Fuels (oil, coal, natural gass, etc)
- 6: Possible prediction of natural geologic events such as volcanoes and earthquakes

## Introduction To Mineralogy

### What is a mineral

A mineral is an element or compound that is
- 1: Inorganic
- 2: Naturally Occurring
- 3: Homogeneous solid - atoms are all mixed together (non uniform arrangement of atoms)
- 4: Definite chemical composition
- 5: Contains atoms that arrange in patterns to form a crystaline structure

**We must know this definition**

### Mineral by the number

- Approx. 4000 recognized on the earth but only 40 are common minerals
- Of these about 15 are considered true rock forming minerals
- 80% of all minerals contain at least 1 of 3 chemical elements - Oxygen, silicon, or alluminum

### The Atomic Patterns of Minerals

- **Crystal**: solid form of a mineral having smooth, flat surfaces
- **Crystalline**: Mineral which just shows an internal pattern of its atoms (no external pattern)
	- All minerals are crystalline, but not all minerals are crystals

### Mineraloids

- A solid or liquid substance that lacks an internal pattern of it's atoms
- Examples: water, mercury, gallium

### Scientific Classification of Minerals

#### A Crystal shape or habit

**Crystallography** - the study of mineral crystals

Types

- 1: Cubic 
	- 3 equal axis's

- 2: Tetragonal System
	- Four sided crystals with 1 unequal axis. Can have pyramids on to and bottom

- 3: Hexagonal
	- Six sided crystals
	- Most common

- 4: Orthorhombic 
	- Rhombus sided crystals usually with pointed ends

- 5: Monoclinic

	- Flat-sheeted crystals
	- examples: mica, gypsum

- 6: Triclinic
	
	- The crystal is like the monoclinic in layers but twisted at 3 different angles

**Twinning**: Two crystals grow together

#### B Chemical composition

7 Major chemical groups

- 1: Native elements

	- Single element ex: Gold
- 2: Halides
	
	- Metal plus a halogen
- 3: Oxide

	- Any metal plus oxygen
- 4: Sulfides
	
	- Any metal plus sulfur

- 5: Sulfates
	
	- Must have sulfur and oxygen, can add any metal

- 6: Carbonates
	
	- Must have carbon and oxygen

- 7: Silicates

	- Silicon and oxygen

At least know quarts is made of SiO2 (Silicon dioxide)

### Polymorhpism

- Just like cs, different minerals composed of same chemical elements but different crystal structures
