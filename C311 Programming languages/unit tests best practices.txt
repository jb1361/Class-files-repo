-Being consistent unity tests should always be the same such as not having random numbers
-no dependent tests and should only be a pass or fail as a result
-tests should only test one scenario (one behavior, can have multiple methods)
 (multiple behaviors but one method should only be one method)
 -keep them simple(no logic and no loops)
 -do not do erreor catching unless there is a expected exception then you throw it
 -have informative assertion messages (have them output values like expected/actual)
	it will improve documentation of the code
-dont make methods in your code that are used only by tests
