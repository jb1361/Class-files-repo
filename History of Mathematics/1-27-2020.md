* Egyptians didnt have pythagorean theorem but did have a concept of pi and had within a 1% error.
* Egyptian Surveyers were called harpedonaptae (rope stretcher)

## Babylonian Mathematics

10 -> 6

12 -> 5

* They had an idea of Quadratics (probably called rectangular equations)
* A common problem was to determine the dimensions of a rectangle given its (semi) perimeter and its area
x+y = a
xy = b

x+y = 20
xy = 91
They would have done soemthing like this
```
x = 10 + z
y = 10 - z
(10 + z)(10 - z) = 91
100 - z^2 = 91
9 = z^2
3 = z
x = 13
y = 7
```
