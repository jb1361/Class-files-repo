Data Formats

CSV:  (Comma seperated values)
-great for flat : represented in a single line.
-log data, collection of sensor data
-easily importe dinto excel
-easily imported into a databases
-easy to parse programatically
-easy sequential acces
-if the file is large, split the file into smaller files


cons:
-no standarization
-not structured
-data can always be different in structure, ect
-lack of metadata



XML: (Xtensible markup language)

-use for structured data
-not necisarily follow object oriented style format like CSV



JSON: (Java script object notation)
-an object, a valid javascript
-best for document interoperability
-consist of a specification
-there are parsers for many different languages
-format is closer to orinal state of data-easy to store in databases

dissavantages:

-verbose
-takes aditional storage may cause bandwidth problems
