-model determinen the coefficient

how do we know if the model is good
-data could be nonlinear
-may be the attributes we trained our model on have little or no being on our output variable

evaluate the effiveness of the model using coefficient determination to quantify the mode R^2

R^2 is a number that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent 
variable that is predictible from the independent variable




sst = ((data-np.mean(data))**2).sum()
ssr = ((predictions - data)**2).sum()
sq = 1-(ssr/sst)

closer R^2 (r_sq) is to 1 the better the model
closer R^2 (r_sq) is to 0 the poorer the model




K-MEANS CLUSTERING

-classifier algorithm

input: k, set of points X1,.....Xn  
k is the number of clusters
place the centroid C1,....Ck at random locations
points in high dimensional vector space

Iterate through the data set until convergance
-for each point X1:
	find the nearest centroid Cj
	assign the point Xi to cluster Cj of minimumDistance, (Xi,Cj)
														^----> euclidian distance, Manhatten distance

														
for each cluster j = 1....k
	new centroid Cj = mean of all points Xi assigned to cluster j in previous step
